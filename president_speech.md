## Presidential Speech Analysis

**Project Description:** For this project, we tried a few simple NLP methods to analyze the speeches of all the US presidents.

**Data:** We gathered the data from three sources: (1) Famous president speeches from [University of Virginia Miller Center](https://millercenter.org/), 
(2) [Varieties of Democracy Score Report](https://kellogg.nd.edu/research/major-research-initiatives/varieties-democracy-project),
and (3) [setiment analysis training dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews) from Kaggle 

**Models:** We used the following analysis methods to draw inference from the dataset:
(1) Generating tweets using a simple Markov model
(2) Sentiment and similarity analysis using the bag-of-words method
(3) LDA analysis
(4) Top-k-frequent words
