## Do People Prefer Tax Policies that Benefit Themselves?


**Project Description:** This project with the [Open Source Economics Lab](https://github.com/OpenSourceEcon) asks the following questions: 
(1) do people prefer tax policies that benefit themselves? and (2) how progressive are the preferred tax policies?
Demographic and tax preference data were collected through a survey that I designed on MTurk.
We found that gender, political affiliation, and age significantly affects tax behaviour and that people of all demographic attributes favor a progressive tax structure.
I also tried a small prediction challenge to fit a decision tree to predict tax behaviour from demographic data.
