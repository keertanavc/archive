## Do People Prefer Tax Policies that Benefit Themselves?


**Project Description:** This project with the [Open Source Economics Lab](https://github.com/OpenSourceEcon) asks the following questions: 
(1) do people prefer tax policies that benefit themselves? and (2) how progressive are the preferred tax policies?
Demographic and tax preference data were collected through a survey that I designed and implemented on MTurk.
The revenue implications of the prefered tax policy rates were simulated using an [open source tax calculator](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator).
Then I analyzed the differences in tax policies along different demographics using statistical significance tests.
I also tried a small prediction challenge to fit a decision tree to predict tax behaviour from demographic data.
