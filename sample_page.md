## Professional Networks and Career Opportunities for Directors in Hollywood

**Project description:** The broad theme of my master's thesis is to understand (1) how career opportunities are distributed in Hollywood, and (2) whether connection or metrit plays a more dominant role in predicting the career opportunities that directors receive. Data from several sources like IMDb is used to build a network of directors, actors, writers, and production houses is generated based on the movies they have collaborated on. Feature vectors for connections are modeled using graph algorithms like centrality and connectedness measures. Merit feature vectors consists of movie ratings, box office collections, awards etc. The target variables are opportunities defined by number of movies, production budgets raised, and career continuity.


Resources are concentrated at the top. Most top production houses work exclusively with top directors.

Tools and models used: 
- Data collection: OMDb API, BeautifulSoup, MPI, 
- Analysis: [CONCOR](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2015/05/concor-in-r/), AWS Spark, NetworkX, GraphX, scipy
- Visualization: seaborn,
